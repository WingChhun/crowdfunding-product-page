        <h2>About this project</h2>

        <p>
          The Mastercraft Bout of Stockamboo Monitor Riser is a sturdy and
          stylish platform that elevates your screen to a more comfortable
          viewing height. Placing your monitor at eye level has the potential to
          improve your posture and make you more comfortable while at work,
          helping you stay focused on the task at hand. Featuring artisan
          craftsmanship, the simplicity of design creates extra desk space below
          your computer to allow notepads, pens, and USB sticks to be stored
          under the stand.
