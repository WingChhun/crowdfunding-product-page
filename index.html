        About this project The Mastercraft BOut of Stockamboo Monitor Riser is a
        sturdy and stylish platform that elevates your screen to a more
        comfortable viewing height. Placing your monitor at eye level has the
        potential to improve your posture and make you more comfortable while at
        work, helping you stay focused on the task at hand. Featuring artisan
        craftsmanship, the simplicity of design creates extra desk space below
        your computer to allow notepads, pens, and USB sticks to be stored under
        the stand.
